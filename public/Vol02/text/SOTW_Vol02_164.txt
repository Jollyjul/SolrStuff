TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
0 thou Star of the West! HE "1 
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long. thou
shalt become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clirne. Thou art the first paper
of the Bahais which is organized in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are
limited. thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakahle, become the object of the
attention of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the
Covenant, in the future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto waves of the sea; thy
volume will increase, thy arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will he raised and
become world-wide--and at last thou shalt become the first paper of the World of humanity. Yet all these
depend upon firmness, firmness, firmness! (Signed)

Extract from a Tablet received by Aga l\-lirza Taraz-0-llah of Gazwin,

editors of the newspapers are mistaken. The literature of the Bahais has encircled
the world and not alone Persia. The derision and the scorn of the editors of the
newspapers will be the cause of their own undoing and regret. They must loosen
their tongues in thankfulness and praise and glorification be to
