Ell LBJALLThe above diagram shows the location and dimensions of the land of the Mashrak-
el-Azkar. It was made for the Bahai Temple Unity by a draftsman of the Drainage
Board of the Sanitary District. What we believe to be of considerable advantage for
our purpose has been gained by the swinging of Greenleaf Avenue eighty feet to the
north of its original route. This was accomplished by our giving up a tract of ground
off the south boundary of the triangle, which lies north of Sheridan Road, for the use
of the street. By this exchange with the village of Wilmette and by the closing of the
fourteen foot alley way running east and west through the ground, the bulk of our land
lies in one beautiful piece, having an area so large that a circle with a diameter of nearly
500 feet can be inscribed within it. At once the architects will see how beautifully this
will lend itself to the nine-sided structure with its nine avenues and fountains, as de-
sired by Abdul-Baha. To Mr. Charles Mason Remey and Mr. Howard C. Struven, when
visiting Acca in 1910, Abdul-Baha said: "The Mashrak-el-Azkar must have nine sides,
doors, fountains, paths, gateways, columns and gardens, with the ground floor galleries
and domes, and in construction and design must be True.
