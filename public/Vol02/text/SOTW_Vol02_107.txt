TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
than Star of the West! HE 13 
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long, thou
shalt become the Star of the.East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper
of the Bahais which is organized in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are
limited, thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakable, become the object of the
attention ot the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the
Covenant, in the future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto waves oi' the sea; thy
volume will increase. thy arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and tame will be raised and
become world-wide--and at last thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these
depend upon firmness, firmness, firmness! (signed)
