Mighty, the Loving, the Merciful! (Signed) ABBAS.
Mr. Mills announced the first business to come before the Convention was the elec-
tion of a Chairman.
On the nomination of Miss Robarts, seconded by Mr. Hannen, Mr. Albert H. Hall,
of Minneapolis, was elected Chairman of the Convention. Assuming the chair, among other
things, he said:
By God's guidance, we have come to this Convention from many different parts.
What we are to do, we do not yet know. I cannot outline to you its mission. But we
all realize that the Unity has outgrown its swaddling clothes. We must henceforth devote
Ourselves seriously, unreservedly to the business divine entrusted to us, that we may allow
nothing to divert us from the task originally undertaken by us, and_ that We take aright
our every step. Not the guidance of our wisdom do we seek; that may only be our
aid. Our guidance and leadership we seek from God. Clear and unmistakable has been
that guidance to us. Out of shadow and confusion we have been led into light, unity and
peace. Tn the great account our results will be found. God knew our resources and has
bee11 putting us for a sojourn in the 'wilderness' to prepare us for His Work. As regularly
as of old came the providence of manna, so about $5,000.00 every six months has come into
our treasury to meet our accruing needs, as if measured down to us by the decimals of the
Infinite. Our obligations have been met, our credit is good, our__faith is assured.
Vile must now prepare for the larger tasks before us, for the work in our hands will grow.
It is not ours; it is His."
