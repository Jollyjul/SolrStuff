2 STAR OF THE WEST
ODE TO THE FIRST UNIVERSAL RACES CONGRESS.
By Miss Alice Mary Buckton.
[liectted at the Opening Sessz'on.]
Hoary-headed, young and old,
Royal-vested, crowned and stoled,
Maker, King and Priest!
Women bearing corn and wine
Lo, they come with songs divine
To the mystic feast!
What Voice is this'? What gathering sound
Upon the Great Highway"!
A Voice no living ear has 
A thousand tongues in a single word--~
A dream the poet's heart has stirred
Since dawn of day!
They come! Who come? Listen!
What thund'rous tread of viewless feet,
From citied walls where waters meet,
From isles of coral foam.
From Western prairies red with corn,
From sacred temples of the morn,
They come!
Their path is the ancient path of pain,
That once the heroes trod!
Their songs are the songs that build the
fane
Unmeasured by human rod;
And the night and tl1e day are one in it
For the world is the tent of God!
Not as strangers seeking pasture,
Feeding flocks in lands unknown;
But, as elder sons returning,
Led with marvel and 
One by\one--
Through the mystic maze returning
As to some ancestral home-
Lo! they come!
And the arching sky this hour is blue
As never sky was seen;
And the living Earth is round today
As never the earth has been.
And the mouths of babes are lisping all
A rune till noW;
And the World-rose breaks in crimson flow
On every common bougl1!
For the city of ancient vision,
Her heavenly towers agleam,
Upon the hills hath arisen
The joy of those that dream!
Wide--wide her gate,
And wide her thoroughfare;
And the roofless dome is great
As the open sky is fair;
And the feet of those who enter
No more shall rove!
For the voice that cried, "Let there be
Light! 
Hath rent the cloud of a darker night--
'Let there be Love! 
And the souls of the races rise abroad,
Each from his place,
To meet his Own! at last, to meet
His brothers, face to face!
They come! They come! With simple
hands
And eager hearts that burn!
White and dark their treasures bringing--
Hark to the voice of the children singing
The Song of the Return!
For the West hath seen, in dumb amaze,
The Mirror of a Timeless Face
Beneath his making hand:
And the East, unveiling things that seem,
Hath ihroned among the powers of dream
The Voice of the Command!
Raise the of wonder,
Mortals, bow the head!
Sec, the silent watchers!
Lo, the mighty dead!
Heirs of a single kingdom
They crown you from their place.
harvest of the nations,
manhood of the race!
Before THE NAMELESS NAME
Ye bow today;
In penitence and shame
One prayer ye pray!
For long-deaf ears have heard the call,
And lips long dumb have ansxvered all
The holy yea, and yea!
No afterdeed shall e'er undo
This thing that ye have done.
No gathering cloud shall ever dim
The brightness of your sun!
The age has traveled with this hour!
Meteors, bend your starry shower,
For, in the heavens of viewless power
Another star is born!
Children of glory, hail!
On every lifted face
Read the tender light
Of the twice-born race!
Behold the Son of Man
In power foretold!
Behold the sons of God
Made manifold!
Swift Cherubim, unfurl
Your flaming swords that burn,
And hear the children sing
The Song of the Return!
The spangled robe of heaven again
Is hung upon the tree,
To deck the Day of the Marriage Feast,
The bridal hour of West and East,
And the dawn of the race to be!
