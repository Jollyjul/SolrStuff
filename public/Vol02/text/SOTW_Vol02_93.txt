in the Tablet to Mrs. Cecilia. M. Harrison, of Chicago, printed on page 6, and the brief
notes of Miss Buckton, of London, printed on page 7. The arising of a few souls to
carry out the hope of Abdul-Baha, who are equipped with the requirements he holds forth,
their journeying to and fro and association With all, will undoubtedly stimulate activity
among the friends, become the cause of unity among the servants, be productive of great
results and conducive to great good.
