TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
HE -is 
0 thou Star of the West!
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long, thou
shalt become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper
of the Bahais which is organized in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are
limited, thy form is small and thy voice weal-:, yet shouldst thou stand unshakable, become the object of the
attention of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the
Covenant, in the future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto waves of the sea; thy
volume will increase, thy arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will be raised and
become at last thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these
depend upon firmnes-s, firmness, firmness! (Signed) ABDUL-BAHA Anus.

NEW GREETING FROM 
HE IS 
ye clilldren of the Kingdom!
It is New Year; that is to say, the rounding of the cycle of the year. A
year is the expression of a. cycle (of the sun) but now is the beginning of 
cycle of Reality, a New Cycle, a New Age, a New Century, a New Time and a
ew Year. The1'ef01'e, it is 'very blessed.
I wish this blessing to appear and become manifest in the faces and char-
acteristics of the believers, so that they, too, may become a new people, and
having found new life and been baptized with fire and spirit, may make the
world a new world, to the end that the old earth may disappear and the new
earth appear; old ideas depart and new thoughts come; old garments be cast
aside and new garments put on; ancient politics whose foundation is war
be discarded and modern politics founded on peace raise the standard of vic-
tory; the new star shine and gleam and the new sun illumine and radiate; new
flowers bloom; the new spring become known; the new breeze blow; the new

Greeting.
