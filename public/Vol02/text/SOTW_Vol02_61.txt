future time to do better work."

do not teach by word of mouth. The teachers are of the first importance; their hves must
be examples.'

"Through the boundless _Favor, I hope that in Seattle by the endeavor of the beloved
of God, certain souls may arise who may prove a radiant lamp to the World of humanity
and merciful spirit to the phenomenal body; that they may be the cause of the purification
of souls and the means of sanctification of hearts; that they may know this mortal world
as fleeting shadow and call the rest and repose, the'pleasure and blessing, the wealth and
sovereignty of the earth, the waves of the sea of imagination; that they may arise in such
wise to live by the Divine Teachings and Exhortations of the Blessed Beauty as to sparkle
l'ke the morning star from the horizon of holiness."
also quoted from a letter from one of the friends in Seattle, the following:
take this way of talking to you as you speed your way over the vast unbroken
waste on your trip to an oasis of spiritual life. You will be nearer to us in spirit by the
necessary strain of our imagination to keep in touch with you. Drink deeply of the cup
of life for us and we will try to be emptied of all else ere you return, to be refilled."
