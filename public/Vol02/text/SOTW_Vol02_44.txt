T0 the of God throughout the Occident:
Referring to the circular letter enclosed in a late number of the BAHAI News, out~
lining the plan for a petition for Inter--Assembly Unity, observed during the Bahai Fast
(March 2-20, inclusive) and followed by a supplication to be sent to Abdul--Baha, bear-
ing the signatures of as many of the friends as possible, begging that he come to
America:
We beg to advise that the response to this call was gratifying, and the prayer seems
to have been quite generally observed. Signatures were received from all parts of the
country, with many words of appreciation and co--operation. The supplication has been
duly prepared, signatures attached to the number of more than 850, and the petition is
on its way to Abdul-Baha. .
The Committee desires to express its appreciation of the hearty response, and if
we can in any further way serve the cause of Inter-Assembly Unity, we are at the com-
mand 0.f the friends, and can be reached through the Secretary.
Faithfully yours,
Charles
