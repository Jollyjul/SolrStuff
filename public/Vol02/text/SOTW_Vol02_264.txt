TO THE FRIENDS OF GOD AND THE MAIDSERVANTS OF THE MEROIFUL IN

nn Is coo!
ye friends God and the beloved of the True One!
Abdul-Baha has the utmost longing to meet you, but now he is obliged to
return to the East, for he has promised many friends and they having trav-
eled a long Way, will be disappointed if the meeting is not brought about.
Therefore, he has returned to Egypt, and hopes: that during the next spring
no obstacle may arise, so that with infinite joy and fragrance he may hasten
to America. to meet the friends, to unfurl the banner of rejoicing, to spread
the Glad-Tidings of the Kingdom of ABHA, to illuminc the meetings and
gatherings with the Rays of the Sun of Truth, to perfume the nostrils with
the Fragrances of Holiness, to impart gladness and delight to the hearts, to
attract the souls to the Realms of Might, to grant the outpouring of the Holy
Spirit--so that in this nether world the congregation of the Righteous Ones
may he firmly (established.
Glad Tidings! Glad Tidings! The bounties of the Most Great Name are
descending. Glad Tidings! Glad Tidings! The Lights of the Kingdom of
ABBA are shining. Glad Tidings! Glad Tidings! The Doors of Heaven are
opened and the call of the Kingdom is raised.
Upon you be Baha 
(Signed) ABDUL--BAHA Asians.
