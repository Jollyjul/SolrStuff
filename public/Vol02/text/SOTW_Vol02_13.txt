STAR OF THE 13
Mr. Gregory has planned to go to Egypt
to meet Abdul-Baha, and it is his inten-
tion to sail from New York, on March
25th. He expects to visit the European
Assemblies while on this trip.
On Thursday, March 9th, our dear
brother, Elwin Moore, was called to the
Higher life. Bahai funeral services were
held at the residence of Dr. E, H. Egbert,
and many of the friends were present. Al-
though Mr. Moore has been away from
us for about a year, his earnest and win-
some personality will be greatly missed.
Our tender sympathy and love are extended
to the widow, formerly Miss Ursula Shu-
man, of this city, and to Mrs. Getsinger
and Miss Hebe I. Moore, his sisters. In
these strong tests of faith, the Bahai spirit
is splendidly triumphant, and thus in long-
delayed fulfilment of prophecy, death has
lost its sting and the grave is despoiled of
its victory. Joseph H. Ha-mien.
