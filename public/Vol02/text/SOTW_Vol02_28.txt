attention of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the
Covenant, in the future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto waves of the sea; thy
volume will increase, thy arena will become Vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will be raised and
become at last thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these
depend upon firmness, fi1"1'rm688, firmness! (Signed) ABDUL-BAHA Asses.
