We have received from London the advance publication (a large book) of the papers
prepared for reading at the first Universal Races Congress, and among them is one from
Abdul-Baha. It is the briefest of them all, being very short, only two pages; and its
character is entirely different from all the others. Theirs are largely from the point of
view of country and race; his is universal. Theirs spend much time and Words to tell
of their ancestral greatness and the abilities of their land and race; he uses few words
and little time to teach the oneness of all mankind, their individual and mutual duties, and
the ueeds of the time. Theirs look to scientific progress, philosophical discussions, courts
of arbitration, commercial interests, or socialistic ideas, to bring about the advance and
better Welfare of mankind. He goes at once to the root of the matter and says: "Today
nothing but the power of the Divine Word, which embraces the Reality of all things, can
draw together the minds, hearts and spirits of the world under the shadow of the heavenly
Tree of Unity. The Light of the \/Vord is now shining on all horizons. . . . Races and
nations, with their various crecds, are coming under the influence of the Word of Unity in
lovc and peace."
In brief, the thought of practically all of those who submitted papers to the Congress,
was from the human point of view, while that_of Abdul-Baha was from the Divine Seeing.
His was primary, theirs secondary. His presentation referred to the very seed and root
of the matter; theirs to the branches and twigs, or results. They failed to perceive that
all the advances of science, philosophy, ideal and action grow out of the spiritual "enlighten-
ment of mankind through the radiance of the Sun of Truth, which is now bathing the World
