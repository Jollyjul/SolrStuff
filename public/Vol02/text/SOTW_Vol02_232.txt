TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
0 thou Star of the West! HE IS 
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long. thou
shalt become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper
or the Bahais which is organized in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are
limited, thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakable, become the object of the
attention of the friends and the center of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the
Covenant, in the future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto waves of the sea; thy
volume will increase, thy arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will be raised and
become world-wide--and at last thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these
depend upon firmness, firmness, firmness! (Signed) ABDUIPBAHA ABBML

We are happy in presenting a recent portrait of Abdul-Baha in this issue of the
STAR on THE As is generally known, for many years, he did not permit a
photograph of himself to be made, although reproductions of one taken when he was
a. young man, had a limited circulation among the friends some years ago. In
answer to a co-mmunication regarding it, Abdul~Baha expressed his Wish, which we
quote herewith, believing it will be read with interest at this time: "'Ve1"ily thou
hast seen the physical picture of Abdul-Baha. printed by the rays of the phenomenal
sun (the photograph) and thine eyes became overflowing with tears. Beg thou of
God that He may show thee his spiritual picture printed by the
rays shining from the Merciful Kingdom. Then the attraction of God shall over-
take thee, and make thee as a spark of fire aiiame with the Love of God."
Word has been received from the editor of The Christian Commonwealth of his
intention to keep its readers (numbering 50,0-00) informed of the progress of the
Bahai Movement. We would suggest that the friends keep in touch with this excellent
Weekly publication, recognized everywhere as an org-an -of the progressive movement
in religion and social ethics. The American postal subscription is $2.11 per annum.
