praised his Wisdom with much enthusiasm. They sought his- advice and found
it of the highest value i.n application to life.
Abdul-Baha has the power to make his friends very happy. 'What
music and harmony, joy and peace, may enter into the lives of those who
attain this meeting! He has a balm for every Wound and feeds hungry
souls with the Manna of his Perfect Love. One of the friends at Cairo, a
noted worker in the Cause, exclaimed, "If I could only see Abdul-Baha once
a Week!" At Acca and. Haifa were to be found those who had spent most
of their lives With him. But they Were all longing for his Presence. Among
the letters received by him at Ramleh Was one from the daughter of a king,
expressing as her utmost desire a visit at the threshold of his door. This is
the Power of the Spirit.
Thus the friends of the Cause may catch a glimpse of What is in store for
them if he visits America. Nor should we spare any pains or hesitate at any
sacrifices to ensure his coming. The Reality of Abdul-Baha, the supreme joy
of the Kingdom, is found by promoting that Which tends to unity and harmony
among the friends of God and the Whole human family.
Son of Man: Lift up thy heart with delight, that thou mayest be
prepared to meet Me and to mirror forth My Beauty."
