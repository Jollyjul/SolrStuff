This money from the Orient was sent in checks on the London bank, and has
been placed in the bank for collection.
The next interest day on the ten thousand dollar mortgage held against the
Mashrak-el-Azkar land will be December .24, 1911. Surely the friends of the
vast and Wealthy continent of America have come into a deeper realization of the
importance of the Mashral:-el-Azlzar and will bend every effort to wipe out this
entire indebtedness on the land by December, so that a fund for the building
may be started. Then the architects will have some encouragement when plans
are submitted at the Convention of 1912.
In a very recent Tablet, Abdul-Baha says: am always waiting that a
good report regarding the Mashral:-el-Azkar should come."

Through Mirza Ahmad to Mr. Thornton Chase.
Upon him be 
HE 1s eon!
thou herald of the Kingdom!
I received tl1y two lettersrecent date, and both of
them were read with the utmost attention. Praise be to God! that thou didst"
not waver before the tests; nay, rather, thou didst remain firm and steadfast.
When the tree sends down its roots into the bowels of the earth, then it will.
bring forth blossoms and fruits. Now, Praise be to God! that i11 this day of the
Kingdom thou art firm and steadfast. Rest thou assured that thou wilt become
the recipient of confirmation a11d assistance, and the object of infinite bounties.
Thou hast asked about the statement in the Hidden Words., which reads:
Son of Spirit! Turn thy face so that thou mayest find Me Within thee, Pow-
erful, Mighty and Supreme." This is the statement to which His Holiness, the
Ohrist, referred His apostles in the Gospel, saying, "The Father is in the Son,
and the Son is in you."
