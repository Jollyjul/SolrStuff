TABLET FROM ABDUL-BAHA.
0 Star of the We-st! is Gm'!
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long, thou
shalt become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper
or the Bahais which is organized in the country or America. Although for the present thysubscribers are
limited, thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakable, become the object of the
attention or the friends and the center oi! the generosity of the leaders oi! the faith who are firm in the
Covenant, in the ifuture thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto waves of the sea; flu
volume will increase, thy arena. will become vast and spacious and thy voice and tame will be raised and
become world-wide--and at last thou shalt become the first paper of the world ofhnmanity. Yet all theta
depend upon firmness, firmness, firmness! 7 7* (7 (Signed) ABBML
