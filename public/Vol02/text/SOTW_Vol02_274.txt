mm Star of the West! HE 18 
Be thou happy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain firm and eternal, ere long, thou
shalt become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper
of the Bahais which is organized in the country of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are
limited, thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakable, become the object of the
attention of the friends and the center ot the generosity ot the leaders or the faith who are firm in the
Covenant, in the future thy subcribers will become hosts after hosts like unto waves or the sea; thy
volume will increase, thy arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and tame will be raised and
become world-wide--and at last thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these
depend upon firmness, firmnessifirmness! ,7 i  (gwned; ABBAE

ALLIANCE SPIR-ITUALISTE OF PARIS R-EOEPTION TO
ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS.
November 9, 1911.
SPEECH BY MONS. LOUIS LE LEU, GENERAL SECRETARY.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Before the l\/laster, Abdul-Baha, takes the chair, I Wish to express to him
in the name of our President and Founder, of the committee and the members
of the Alliance Spiritualiste, our gratitude for the benevolence he has shown
in accepting our invitation today.
Those who have assembled here to listen to you, Master, know already,
by the fame Which has preceded you, that you come from the Orient to give
to the Occident that truth for which you have suffered after your illustrious
Father and his precursor, the Bab.
I dio not Want to infringe upon the ground over Which. you are going to
lead us, assisted by your devoted interpreter, Mons. Dreyfus, Who has already
given us a volume of great clearnes-s on the principles. and history of Bahaism.
By the sympathy Which you have evoked here in Paris, as Well as during
your recent sojourn in London, you will recognize the heart of the Occident
and Orient beating in unison under the influence of the same light.
