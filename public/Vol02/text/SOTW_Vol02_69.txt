We are pleased to present the following extract .fron1 a recent letter by Mr. Louis
G. Gregory, of Washington, D. 0., who is visiting Abdul-Baha in Egypt, not only be-
cause it contains news from that center,.but for the timely suggestion it contains:
RAMLEH, EGYPT, April 15, 1911.
Have been here nearly a week and seen much of Abdul-Baha. The friends here show
great devotion to the Cause, and many, not believers, show great reverence and love for
Abdul-Baha, some coming long distances to see him. He exercises the utmost kindness
toward all.
Yesterday he called my attention to a Tablet revealed to friends in Persia, saying it
was being sent to thirty believers. Sometimes, he said, one Tablet was sent to a hundred
Persians, While many individual Tablets were sent to Americans. I answered that we were
indeed highly favored. Later in the day he said he wanted me to go to Persia after a time
and see how beautiful were the lives of the friends, as they have been refined and purified
by much suffering and they show forth great love and spirituality. I have observed that
the secretaries of Abdul-Baha have' no little ditiiculty deciphering proper names in letters
sent here from America, and suggest that these be written plainly; also, in view of the
great amount of work, that supplication be made as brief as possible. In fact, I think. it
would be well if many Americans, as do the Persians, unite in one supplication. Thus,
Abdul~Baha would have more time to give to others 1I1 need of Light, for in his presence
is Light, Joy and Peace.
Tomorrow a party of pilgrims leave for the I-Ioly City.
