ABDUL-BAHA.
0 mm Star of the West! HE IS 
Be thou haDDy! Be thou happy! Shouldst thou continue to remain and eternal, ere long, thou
shalt become the Star of the East and shalt spread in every country and clime. Thou art the first paper
of the Bahais which is organized in the coimtry of America. Although for the present thy subscribers are
limited, thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakable, become the object of the
attention of the triends and the center of the generosity of the leaders or the faith who are firm in the
Covenant, in the future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto waves of the sea; thy
volume will increase. thy arena will become vast and spacious and thy voice and fame will be raised and
become at last thou shalt become the first paper of the world of humanity. Yet all these
depend upon firmness, firmness, firmness! (Signed)

TO THE BAI-IAI ASS-E-MBLIES OF NORTH AND ALL FRIENDS IN
CAUSE OF GOD,

Bahai Temple Unity, by its Executive Board, announces and herewith
calls the Fourth Annual Meeting of the Unity, to be held at the City of
Chicago, Illino-is, during the last six days of the Rizwan 27th to
May 2nd, inclusive, for conference and action upon the appointed
reports, business and election of officers of the Unity.
We are assured that, God Willing, this meeting will be blessed and in-
spired with the personal presence of the beloved Abdul~Baha Abbas, and that
this will be the long-anticipated and memorable occasion of the consecration
by this loving and faithful Center of the Covenant of the -site of the first
Mashrak-cl-Azkar in the West.
This joyful consummation has been and will be made possible by the glad
offerings of many men and Women from all people and religions, civilizations
and lands of the earth, who have been attracted to and unified in this object
by the inspiring word and the unccasing service and the unbounded love of
Abdul-B aha.
